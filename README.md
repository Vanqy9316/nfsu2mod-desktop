## Why a desktop client?

[Underground 2 Revived](https://nfsu2mod.xyz/) is a web port of the classic 2004 racing game *Need for Speed: Underground 2*, running directly in modern browsers via static recompilation (`NFSU2Recomp`), WebAssembly, and WebGPU. While it runs inside standard web browsers, standard browser tabs introduce several pain points during gameplay and online multiplayer:

- **Alt-tabbing throttles background tabs:** Regular browsers throttle timers and renderers when minimized or occluded. Tabbing out to check Discord, change music, or look at a map can desync or drop your online Free Roam and race sessions.
- **Integrated vs. discrete GPU:** Laptops frequently default web browsers to low-power integrated graphics rather than your dedicated NVIDIA or AMD GPU.
- **Screen sleep on controller or wheel:** Driving with a gamepad or racing wheel without touching keyboard or mouse can trigger Windows screen timeout mid-race.
- **F12 screenshot conflicts:** Browsers typically intercept `F12` for developer tools, conflicting with the game's native `F12` screenshot feature.

This desktop client wraps `nfsu2mod.xyz` in a clean, high-performance Electron environment with dedicated GPU flags, zero background throttling, and controller wake-lock enabled out of the box.

## Download & Install

Grab the latest installer `Underground 2 Revived Setup.exe` from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/DJTOMATO/nfsu2desktop/releases).

## What's configured under the hood

- **Forced Dedicated GPU Acceleration:** Launches with `force_high_performance_gpu`, `ignore-gpu-blocklist`, `enable-unsafe-webgpu`, `enable-gpu-rasterization`, `enable-zero-copy`, and `enable-oop-rasterization` so Dawn/WebGPU utilizes your dedicated graphics card with zero-copy frame presentation.
- **No Background Throttling:** Background throttling is completely disabled (`disable-renderer-backgrounding`, `disable-background-timer-throttling`, `disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`, `backgroundThrottling: false`), allowing you to alt-tab freely without disconnecting from multiplayer lobbies or online Free Roam.
- **Full WebAssembly Performance:** Full support for WebAssembly JSPI (`WebAssembly.Suspending`), `try_table` exception handling, tail calls, and SIMD.
- **3 GB Local Disk Cache:** Generous local disk cache keeps the ~1.8 GB streamed game assets, textures, and binaries cached locally for fast repeat launches without cache eviction.
- **Discord Rich Presence (RPC):** Shows your live in-game status directly on your Discord profile (Cruising Free Roam with nearby drivers, Drift scoring, Multiplayer races, tuning in the Garage, or Photo Mode).
- **Instant Automatic Updates (`nfsu2mod.js`):** Automatically syncs the latest Discord statuses and game improvements on startup, so you enjoy new features without having to re-download or reinstall the desktop client.
- **Persistent Profiles & Cloud Vault:** Your saved profiles, settings, and cloud vault credentials remain persisted in your client profile.
- **Display Sleep Blocker:** Prevents Windows display sleep while the client is open, ensuring uninterrupted sessions on gamepads and wheels.
- **Native Shortcut Handling:** Preserves `F12` for in-game screenshots and moves DevTools to `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
